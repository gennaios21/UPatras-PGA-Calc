# ece-MO-calc
This app/webpage is used to calculate a UPatras ECE or CEID student's new PGA, given the number of passed lessons and the current PGA. They can add lessons and enter the specific grade, as well as their thesis. They can also download the WDP.xls file from Progress->Academic Work and import it on the app, to automatically calculate their current PGA and passed lessons.

To start, open 'main.html' in your browser.
